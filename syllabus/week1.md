## Week 1

We'll have an overview of the course and take time to ensure everyone is setup and ready to code!

### Lab Work

#### Course Introduction

##### Course will cover the following topics

* Command line
  * Most web developers use the commandline to carry out the majority of their tasks.
  * We'll cover the basics of the commandline along with doing some practice work in the Week 2 lab.
* Git & GitHub
  * Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code.
  * GitHub is a website that hosts git repositories. Its a home for most of the world's code.
  * Git is used by almost all web developers and is standard practice within all organizations.
  * We'll cover the basics of git and how to use it to collaborate with others.
  * In week 2, we'll practice on a project that you can use to take class notes!
* HTML
  * HTML is the markup language that is used to create web pages.
  * Almost all webpages are written in HTML.
  * We'll cover the basics of HTML and how to use it to create web pages.
  * In week 3, we'll practice by making a biographical webpage about yourself that uses some of the most popular HTML tags.
* CSS
  * CSS is the language that is used to style web pages and make them look pretty.
  * In week 4, we'll practice by taking your HTML biography page and adding some CSS to make it look nice.

These topics are foundational concepts that will serve as a springboard for creating any type of content hosted on the web. With these basics in place, you can branch out in to specific domains that you're interested in such as web applications, games, or mobile apps.

##### Course Logistics

* Course structure will generally involve reading about the topic at home and then doing a lab at class to practice what you've learned.
* The course will use the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) as a resource and guideline for learning the topics.
* We can use the STEAM Innovation Lab slack channel to ask questions and get help from each other.

If there's interest to continue learning after this course, we can setup followup classes to learn more advanced topics.

##### Development environment setup

* [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Create a [Github account](https://github.com)
* Install Docker
  * [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
  * [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
  * [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* Confirm VS Code is setup to load assignments, run the commandline, and run git commands
  * Check Codespaces configuration as well

### Homework

* Read [Commandline Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-command-line-basics)
