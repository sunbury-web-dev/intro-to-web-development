## Week 2

### Lab Work

Project: In this lab we'll clone a repostiory that contains some templates for taking class notes in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). We'll practice using git to clone the repository, make changes, and push those changes to GitHub.
* Goals:
  * clone a repository
  * make branches
  * make commits
  * push changes to `origin`
  * revert changes
  * merge changes with someone else

Directions:
  * Add a new file and commit the changes
    * After accepting the assignment from GitHub, clone the repository to your machine or fire up a Codespace.
    * Create a new branch for your notes.
    * Create a new file in the `notes` directory with the name of the topic you want to take notes on. For example, if you want to take notes on git, create a file called `git.md`.
    * Add some notes to the file. You can use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to format your notes.
    * Commit your changes and push your new branch to [GitHub](https://github.com).
    * Create a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.
    * Have someone else review your pull request and resolve any feedback.
    * Merge your pull request into the `main` branch and delete your branch.
    * Pull the latest changes from `origin` to your local machine and confirm your changes are there.
    * Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

  * Practice using Git to revert changes
    * Try making another change to your notes, commit it, and push it to `origin`.
    * Revert your changes by creating a new branch and reverting the commit that you made.
    * Commit your changes and push your new branch to [GitHub](https://github.com).
    * Create a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.
    * Have someone else review your pull request and resolve any feedback.
    * Merge your pull request into the `main` branch and delete your branch.
    * Pull the latest changes from `origin` to your local machine and confirm your changes are there.
    * Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
