## Week 2

### Goals

* Practice commandline basics
* Clone a repository
* Make branches
* Make commits
* Push changes to `origin`
* Revert changes
* Merge changes with someone else

### Lab Work

#### Project

In this lab we'll begin by using the commandine to create a folder and a file and then removing that foler and file.

After that we'll clone a repository (or open a Codespace) that contains some templates for taking class notes in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). We'll practice using git to clone the repository, make changes, and push those changes to GitHub.

#### Directions

##### Managing files with the commandline
* Open a terminal window and create a new directory called `test`
* Navigate to the `test` directory
* Create a new file called `test.txt`
* Open the file in VS Code and make a few changes, save the file and close it.
* Navigate back out of the `test` directory
* Delete the `test` directory

##### Adding a new file to the repository
* After accepting the assignment from GitHub, clone the repository to your machine or fire up a Codespace.
* Create a new branch for your notes.
* Create a new file in the `notes` directory with the name of the topic you want to take notes on. For example, if you want to take notes on git, create a file called `git.md`.
* Add some notes to the file. You can use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to format your notes.
* Commit your changes and push your new branch to [GitHub](https://github.com).
* Create a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.
* Have someone else review your pull request and resolve any feedback.
* Merge your pull request into the `main` branch and delete your branch.
* Pull the latest changes from `origin` to your local machine and confirm your changes are there.
* Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

##### Practice using git to revert changes
* Try making another change to your notes, commit it, and push it to `origin`.
* Revert your changes by creating a new branch and reverting the commit that you made.
* Commit your changes and push your new branch to [GitHub](https://github.com).
* Create a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.
* Have someone else review your pull request and resolve any feedback.
* Merge your pull request into the `main` branch and delete your branch.
* Pull the latest changes from `origin` to your local machine and confirm your changes are there.
* Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
