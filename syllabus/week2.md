## Week 2

### Goals

* Practice commandline basics
* Fork a repository
* Make branches
* Make commits
* Push changes to `origin`
* Revert changes

### Lab Work

#### Project

In this lab we'll begin by using the commandine to create a folder and a file and then removing that folder and file.

After that we'll fork a repository and then clone (or open a Codespace) that contains some templates for taking class notes in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). We'll practice using git to clone the repository, make changes, and push those changes to GitHub.
