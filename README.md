# Intro to Web Development

## Description

This course is a foundation to begin learning web development. Web development is the practice of building websites that are accessible over the Internet. These websites could be as simple as a single page biography of yourself, or entire full fledged applications like AirBnB, Mastodon, or Facebook (to name just a few!). This course is going to cover the very basics of web develpment such as becoming familiar with the command line, using Git to track changes to your work, and using HTML and CSS to layout a webpage. With these basics under your belt you'll have a springboard to take things further and build more interactive websites.

This course is currently going to be a loose fork of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)

## Prerequisites

## Course Outline

### [Week 1](https://github.com/sunbury-web-dev/intro-to-web-development-syllabus/blob/main/syllabus/week1.md)

We'll have an overview of the course and take time to ensure everyone is setup and ready to code!

### [Week 2](https://github.com/sunbury-web-dev/intro-to-web-development-syllabus/blob/main/syllabus/week2.md)

We'll practice using basic Git operations such as cloning, making branches, commits, and merges.

### [Week 3](https://github.com/sunbury-web-dev/intro-to-web-development-syllabus/blob/main/syllabus/week3.md)

We'll dive into HTML and use a basic boilerplate along with popular tags to create personal profile pages and then add those pages to a class directory. 

### [Week 4](https://github.com/sunbury-web-dev/intro-to-web-development-syllabus/blob/main/syllabus/week4.md)

Students will build a personal website (multiple pages) about themselves. This website should have multiple linking pages via a main menu and use the correct HTML boilerplate.
